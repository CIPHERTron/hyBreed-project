# hyBreed-project
It is a small project which basically depicts my web development journey so far. This project consists of all the minor projects I've done till date. It contains:-

1. A Portfolio Site which is created by using mainly HTML and a few inline CSS codes. This is my first project in the field of Web Development.
2. inPhasePDF pdf viewer which is a desktop application. I haven't developed the application but I've designed a static website for it from where people can download it and know      about it's various unique features. I used HTML , CSS and Bootstrap. It's a responsive design.
3. Dice Game which is a simple game made using ground basics of javascript. Here, one of the user has to refresh the page to roll two dice. It's a fun project basically.
4. Drum Roll which is a drumming set site which is made using HTML , CSS and some JS concepts like query selectors, adding event listeners, functions, loop, etc.
5. Simon Game which is basically a web version of the age-old memory game Simon. You must remember and repeat a series of button presses, while the speed increases with each step.    It is made using advanced javascript concepts.
6. Calculator - A simple calculator uniquely designed, which is capable of doing all arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus and even      factorial. Yes, you heard that right. My calculator has a factorial functionality too.

I'm a total beginner in this field and looking forward to enhance my knowledge and get guidance from the Opencode community. 
Thank You!
